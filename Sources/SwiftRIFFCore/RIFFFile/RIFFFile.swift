/// Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is a generic file container format for storing data in tagged chunks.
/// It is historically used primarily for audio and video but can be used for nearly any content.
///
/// The 'directory entries' are defined by chunks. Every chunk contains either data or a list of chunks.
///
/// The first chunk is the root entry and must have a ID of "RIFF" or "RIFX", the former being the most
/// common version. "RIFF" specifies little-endian byte ordering, whereas the less common "RIFX" specifies
/// big-endian byte order.
